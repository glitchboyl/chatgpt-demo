When you start the application, you should see there is a arrow in the top bar.

when you have click it, it will open a popper that contains an API key input box.

Input your own API key, and then enjoy using it!

## Tips

The first message may respond very slowly, because it's loading the language bundles that are used to highlight the code.

After that, it will resume to normal response speed. (I supposed)
